# wE hAvE OsU aT hOMe (by Mayuwhim)
A really funny school project

Basically, this is a bad version of the hit rhythm game osu!

This is scuffed in so many ways (I even had to change some backgrounds lol), hence the "at home" deduction. I'm just uploading this because I'm kinda proud of it (pretty new to coding), don't expect anything further here. This is also my first GitHub upload which makes this extra scuffed.

The entire game is in 2 files which probably breaks half a million convention rules, so brace yourselves

Also I have no clue how Git works so no gitignoring here unfortunately

# Installation
- You need Eclipse IDE for Java (not sure if other IDEs work, never tried)
- Download the code
- Move `osu`, `hsa2`, and `module-info.java` into your project `src` folder
- Go [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15eqHXY9hrIGjIywWd_-On57bbmNNzXPK/view?usp=sharing) to download maps, unzip into a folder called `osuYM`, and put it in your project folder (the folder `src` is in)
Note: The maps folder is ~250MB because of songs and images, so uploading it to github was a no-no.
- Run `OsuReader.java` in Eclipse

# Notes (also in the program file) (reminder this had to pass for a school project):
 * Written by Mayuwhim

 * osu!
 * 
 * How to play:
 * 1. Select a map
 * 2. Click with mouse or tap keys on the notes to the song
 * 3. Sliders must be tapped at the start then followed
 * 4. Spinners must be held and spun around the middle
 * 
 * Tip: Accuracy is quite harsh, but listening to the song helps a lot
 * 
 * Thanks to Dean Herbert (ppy) for making the real game
 * Thanks to the osu! community for providing maps and assets
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - All time-keeping is done is milliseconds unless stated otherwise
 * - The program is really long and complicated, I tried my best to comment things
 * - ~~The planning document may help with understanding why I'm doing what I'm doing~~ **planning document is not included**
 * - Recommended to read OsuClasses first to get a better sense of how notes work
 * - Some maps have a "break" at the start where there are no notes, just wait a bit
 * - Enjoy!
